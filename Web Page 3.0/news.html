I took the oppertunity to study abroad first semester of my sophmore year. I studied at the University of New Haven Prato campus in Italy. While I was there I traveled to multiple places within Italy such as Rome, Venice, Chinque Terre, Pompeii, Naples, and many other small cities. I also had to oppertunity to travel to other countires such as Germany, Spain, France, and Morocco.

	I am involved on the Incendio Dance Project team. This is the first and only salsa team that is on campus. I orginally got involved while i was studying abroad and decided that I wanted to continue to be apart of it back on the main campus. I am the executive assistant on the E-Board and help make decisions reguarding the team and its activities.
